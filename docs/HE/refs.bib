abstract = {This chapter focuses on finite volume methods. The finite volume method is a discretization method that is well suited for the numerical simulation of various types (for instance, elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic) of conservation laws; it has been extensively used in several engineering fields, such as fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, or petroleum engineering. Some of the important features of the finite volume method are similar to those of the finite element method: it may be used on arbitrary geometries, using structured or unstructured meshes, and it leads to robust schemes. The finite volume method is locally conservative because it is based on a “balance" approach: a local balance is written on each discretization cell that is often called “control volume;” by the divergence formula, an integral formulation of the fluxes over the boundary of the control volume is then obtained. The fluxes on the boundary are discretized with respect to the discrete unknowns.},

@article{Boggs1995,
abstract = {A new method, referred to as the sequential quadratic programming method, is presented for determining minimum energy paths. The method is based on minimizing the points representing the path in the subspace perpendicular to the tangent of the path while using a penalty term to prevent kinks from forming. Rather than taking one full step, the minimization is divided into a number of sequential steps on an approximate quadratic surface. The resulting method can efficiently determine the reaction mechanism, from which transition state can be easily identified and refined with other methods. To improve the resolution of the path close to the transition state, points are clustered close to this region with a reparametrization scheme. The usefulness of the algorithm is demonstrated for the Muller-Brown potential, amide hydrolysis, and an 89 atom cluster taken from the active site of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase for the reaction which catalyzes 2-oxo-4-hexenedioate to the intermediate 2-hydroxy-2,4-hexadienedioate.},

@article{Leyffer2005,
abstract = {For solving nonlinear optimization problems, two competing iterative approaches are available: active set methods and interior-point methods. Current implementations of interior methods often outperform active set methods in terms of speed. On the other hand, active set methods are more robust and better suited for warm starts, which are important for solving integer optimization problems. Consequently, we have recently become interested in new active set approaches, which are reviewed in this note.},
