@article{Kuo2006,
abstract = {This paper presents a new technique, which can apply the stress-based finite element method to Euler-Bernoulli beams. An approximated bending stress distribution is selected, and then the approximated transverse displacement is determined by twice integration. Due to the satisfaction of compatibility, the integration constants are determined by the boundary conditions related to transverse displacement and rotation. To compare with the displacement-based finite element method, this technique provides the continuities of not only transverse displacement and rotation but also stress at nodes. Besides, the boundary conditions related to stress are satisfied. Two numerical examples demonstrate the validity of this technique. The results show that the errors are smaller than those generated by the displacement-based finite element method for the same number of degrees of freedom.},

@article{Boggs1995,
abstract = {Since its popularization in the late 1970s, Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) has arguably become the most successful method for solving nonlinearly constrained optimization problems. As with most optimization methods, SQP is not a single algorithm, but rather a conceptual method from which numerous specific algorithms have evolved. Backed by a solid theoretical and computational foundation, both commercial and public-domain SQP algorithms have been developed and used to solve a remarkably large set of important practical problems. Recently large-scale versions have been devised and tested with promising results.},

@book{Attaway2013,
abstract = {In this chapter, selected advanced mathematical concepts and related built-in functions in the MATLAB{\textregistered} software are introduced. The first section in this chapter first explores fitting simple polynomial curves to data. Other topics include complex numbers and a brief introduction to differentiation and integration in calculus. Some symbolic math functions, all of which are in Symbolic Math Toolbox™ in MATLAB, are also introduced. Solutions to sets of linear algebraic equations are important in many applications. To solve systems of equations using MATLAB, there are basically two methods, both of which will be covered in this chapter: using a matrix representation and using the solve function (which is part of Symbolic Math Toolbox™).},

abstract = {This extensive rigorous texbook, developed through instruction at MIT, focuses on nonlinear and other types of optimization: iterative algorithms for constrained and unconstrained optimization, Lagrange multipliers and duality, large scale problems, and the interface between continuous and discrete optimization. Among its special features, the book: 1) provides extensive coverage of iterative optimization methods within a unifying framework 2) provides a detailed treatment of interior point methods for linear programming 3) covers in depth duality theory from both a variational and a geometrical/convex analysis point of view 4) includes much new material on a number of topics, such as neural network training, discrete-time optimal control, and large-scale optimization 5) includes a large number of examples and exercises detailed solutions of many of which are posted on the internet Much supplementary/support material can be found at the book's web page http://www.athenasc.com/nonlinbook.html},

@article{Lyness1968,
abstract = {In a previous paper (Lyness and Moler [11), several closely related formulas of use for obtaining a derivative of an analytic function numerically are derived. Each of these formulas consists of a convergent series, each term being a sum of function evaluations in the complex plane. In this paper we introduce a simple generalization of the previous methods; we investigate the "truncation error" associated with truncating the infinite series. Finally we recommend a particular differentiation rule, not given in the previous paper.},

@article{Lazarov2012,
abstract = {The aim of this paper is to introduce the stochastic collocation methods in topology optimization for mechanical systems with material and geometric uncertainties. The random variations are modeled by a memory-less transformation of spatially varying Gaussian random fields which ensures their physical admissibility. The stochastic collocation method combined with the proposed material and geometry uncertainty models provides robust designs by utilizing already developed deterministic solvers. The computational cost is discussed in details and solutions to decrease it, like sparse grids and discretization refinement are proposed and demonstrated as well. The method is utilized in the design of compliant mechanisms.},
