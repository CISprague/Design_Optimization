abstract = {This paper examines atmospheric drag models and data usage involved with propagating near-Earth satellites. Many studies, and even some International standards try to promote one model over another, rather than identifying the behavior of the numerous parameters necessary to select the best model for a particular mission and application. We briefly summarize existing information, and quantify sources of uncertainty in satellite propagation resulting from several atmospheric models, or from the treatment of input data indices. The goal is for researchers to understand the relative impact of using different models and data indices so they can properly assess which model and data input to use. ?? 2013 IAA.

The observed density seasonal variability is consistent with recent observations obtained by stellar occultations, proving that this method, though not as accurate as stellar occultations could be used complementary to them to characterize large variations of thermospheric density on Mars and provide a better spatial coverage by Lyman-$\alpha$ imagery. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {WELCOME HOME SpaceX has successfully launched and landed a Falcon 9 rocket—and made history The first stage returns—for further use. (Reuters/Joe Skipper) Share Written by Steve Mollman Obsession Space Business December 21, 2015 SpaceX made history last night (Dec. 21) in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The company, amid much jubilation, landed a Falcon 9 reusable rocket that had shortly before been in orbital space delivering satellites. It was a major step for the company, founded by Elon Musk, co-founder of PayPal and Tesla Motors. SpaceX suffered a serious setback in June when a Falcon 9 bound for the International Space Station exploded after a few minutes of flight. It was also a major step for private companies in space. The rocket carried a payload of 11 satellites owned by SpaceX customer Orbcomm, a communications firm based in New Jersey. Because they're used more than once, reusable rockets make space access considerably cheaper, saving private space companies tens of millions of dollars and promising to make them financially viable entities. Conventional rockets, by contrast, are discarded following each launch, significantly driving up costs. Another private space company, Blue Origin—started by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos—also launched and landed a reusable rocket last month. But that rocket is designed for carrying tourists to the edge of orbital space, not into it.},

abstract = {In this paper, the task of achieving the soft landing of a lunar module such that the fuel consumption and the flight time are minimized is formulated as an optimal control problem. The motion of the lunar module is described in a three dimensional coordinate system. We obtain the form of the optimal closed loop control law, where a feedback gain matrix is involved. It is then shown that this feedback gain matrix satisfies a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. The optimal control problem is first solved as an open loop optimal control problem by using a time scaling transform and the control parameterization method. Then, by virtue of the relationship between the optimal open loop control and the optimal closed loop control along the optimal trajectory, we present a practical method to calculate an approximate optimal feedback gain matrix, without having to solve an optimal control problem involving the complex Riccati-like matrix differential equation coupled with the original system dynamics. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is highly effective. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {It is not surprising that the development of numerical methods for trajectory optimization have closely paralleled the exploration of space and the development of the digital computer. Space exploration provided the impetus by presenting scientists and engineers with challenging technical problems. The digital computer provided the tool for solving these new problems. The goal of this paper is to review the state of the art in the field loosely referred to as trajectory optimization. Presenting a survey of a field as diverse as trajectory optimization is a daunting task. The author focuses on the two types of methods most widely used today, namely, direct and indirect. I begin the discussion with a brief review of the underlying mathematics in both direct and indirect methods. I then discuss the complications that occur when path and boundary constraints are imposed on the problem description. Finally, I describe unresolved issues that are the subject of ongoing research},

Like the clothoids, cubic curvature polynomials are relatively difficult to compute but are easy to execute. A real-time numerical method to compute them is described.},
